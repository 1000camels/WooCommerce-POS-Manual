{% hint style='info' %}
This feature requires an upgrade to [WooCommerce POS Pro](http://wcpos.com/pro).
{% endhint %}

A full Reports integration into the POS interface is on the roadmap for version 0.6 but you can already use some POS specific reports via the [WooCommerce POS Admin Reports](/reports/wc-admin-reports.md) section and test a [Z-Report](/reports/z-report.md) (simple, POS only, daily report) made available in the form of a WorPress Template to be downloaded and included in your theme.
