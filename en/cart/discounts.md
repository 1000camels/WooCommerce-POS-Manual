With WooCommerce POS you can apply a discount in two ways;

1.  you can add an **Order Discount**, or,
2.  you can adjust the **Item Price**

These discounts are consistent with WooCommerce, changes to item price are done **before** the tax calculation and an order discount is **after** the tax calculation.

### Order Discount

Clicking the Discount button at the bottom of the cart will display a field for your discount amount. 
This amount will be taken off the order total and it is important to note, an **Order Discount does not change the Tax**. 

If you are using the number pad you can enter the discount as either an amount or as a percentage, eg: 20% will take 20% off the order total. 
The number pad also has 4 'quick keys' for applying a discount.

### Item Price

Clicking on the item price will allow you to alter the price on the fly. 
**Changing the Item Price will also change the tax amount**. 
For example, reducing the item price by 10% will also reduce the tax on that item by 10%. 
If you wanted to reduce the entire order by 10%, including tax, you would have to reduce each line item. 

The item price number pad allows you to enter either a price, or a discount as a percentage. 
You will notice that items that you have placed 'on sale' in WooCommerce will display the corresponding discount in the POS cart.
