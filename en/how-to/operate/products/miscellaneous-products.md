There may be times when you need to sell an item that is not part of your WooCommerce inventory. 
Below are two options for selling _miscellaneous products_ in WooCommerce POS.

* [Create a POS Only Product](#create-a-pos-only-product) (recommended)
* [Use a Fee Line Item](#use-a-fee-line-item)

### Create a POS Only Product

Using the [POS Only](/how-to/configure/products/pos-only-products.md) feature, you can create a _miscellaneous product_ for use in the POS. 
The _title_, _sale price_, _regular price_, _tax rate_ and _meta information_ can all be changed on-the-fly during checkout. 
The benefit of using a POS Only Product is that you can collect reports on how many _miscellaneous products_ you sell.

### Use a Fee Line Item

Using a Fee line item is similar to creating a POS Only Miscellaneous Product. 
Cashiers can quickly update the title, price and tax rate of Fee. 
The main drawback is that Fee's may appear separate to products in your reporting.
