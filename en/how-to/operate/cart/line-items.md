### Product Line Items

When a product is added to the cart it becomes a new line item for that order. 
It is possible to edit the quantity, title and sale price for each product line item. 
Additionally, by clicking on the arrow icon you can access the product 'drawer' to edit the regular price, taxable status, tax rate and meta data. 
Clicking the red 'x' icon will remove the line item from the cart.

Typically, product line items are grouped together, for example `4 x Flying Ninja`. 
However, there may be situations when you need to split the product into individual line items. 
First add the total number of products you require (or increase quantity), once the quantity is above 1, a _Split_ link will appear. 
Clicking the _Split_ link will separate the product into line items. 
You can now edit the title, price and meta data for each line item as you desire.
