### Browser



### Network

Some modern printers are able to receive raw commands directly over the network.
These printers are ideal for use with tablets or mobile phones as they don't need a special printer driver.
Espon often calls these *intelligent* printers, such as the [Epson TM-T70-i Intelligent Printer](http://www.epson.com.au/pos/products/receiptprinters/DisplayMain.asp?id=TM-T70-i) or the [Epson TM-T88V-i Intelligent Printer](http://www.epson.com.au/pos/products/receiptprinters/DisplayMain.asp?id=tmt88v-i).

### QZ Tray

[QZ Tray](https://qz.io/) is a free application for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux computers.
QZ Tray allows the browser to send raw commands to printers connected via USB, Serial or the Network.
For more information please see [*What is Raw Printing*](https://qz.io/wiki/What-is-Raw-Printing).

### Print to file

Printing to file will output the raw receipt data to a designated folder on your computer.
This can be useful for debugging or custom print processes.
