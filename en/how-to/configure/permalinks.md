WooCommerce POS requires URL rewrites (sometimes called [_pretty_ permalinks](http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks)) to function correctly.


By default, the POS is accessed by going to `https://yourstore.com/pos`, where _yourstore_ is your store domain. 
This can be changed in `WP Admin > Settings > Permalinks` by updating the POS base.
