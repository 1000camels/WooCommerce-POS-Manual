### Barcode scanning overview

WooCommerce POS allows to quickly add Products to the Cart by using the special Barcode scanning mode. This mode can be activated by either clicking on the icon next to the search field or by [using the appropriate HotKey](/hotkeys.md).

### Custom Barcode field
By default WooCommerce POS will use the _SKU_ field of a Product as barcode meta field but this can be changed in the [Products Settings Panel](/settings/custom-barcode-field.md) or programatically by using the `woocommerce_pos_barcode_meta_key` filter.

[WooCommerce POS Pro](http://wcpos.com/pro) users can use any product meta field by selecting a Barcode Field in `WP Admin > POS > Settings > General`

The following features are being planned for future releases:

*   Barcode scanning using mobile device camera. This will require a native WooCommerce POS app to gain access to the device hardware. Native apps are on the wish list but adding features toÂ the web version is the highest priority at the moment.
*   Hot key activation
