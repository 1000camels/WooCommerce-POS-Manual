After [installation](./installation.md), you can access the POS by going to `https://yourstore.com/pos`, where _yourstore_ is your store domain. 
This URL can be given to staff to access the POS directly. 
You can change the _pos_ slug at any time via the [Permalink settings](/how-to/configure/permalinks.md).

WordPress users with the role `Administrators` and `Shop Manager` are given full access to the POS by default. 
A `Cashier` role is also included with the POS, this gives basic access to the POS without any access to the WordPress Admin. 
For more information on restricting privileges for POS users please see read the documentation on how to configure [POS Access](/how-to/configure/pos-access.md).
