[WooCommerce POS Pro](http://wcpos.com/pro) is a paid plugin which adds functionality to the free [WooCommerce POS plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pos/). If you have purchased a license for WooCommerce POS Pro please follow the steps below to install and activate the plugin:

1.  Go to: [http://wcpos.com/my-account/](http://wcpos.com/my-account/)
2.  Under **My Downloads**, click the download link and save the plugin to your desktop.
3.  Then go to your site, login and go to the **Add New Plugin** page, eg: http://_<yourstore.com>_/wp-admin/plugin-install.php?tab=upload
4.  Upload the plugin zip file from your desktop and activate.
5.  Next, go to the **POS Settings** page and enter your License Key and License Email to complete the activation.

**Note:** you need WooCommerce POS (the free version) installed together with Pro. Pro adds functionality to the free plugin.
